Below is a rewritten step-by-step guide to completing the COMP30027 Machine Learning Project 2: Traffic Sign Prediction, tailored to your current progress (data loading, merging, and basic preprocessing in a Jupyter Notebook) and addressing your uncertainty about model training. This guide is conceptual, avoids code, and focuses on a clear, actionable path to meet the project requirements (data preparation, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, Kaggle submission, and report writing). It builds on your existing work and incorporates the improvements made in the updated code (e.g., merging labels, standardizing features, handling test data). The steps are streamlined to guide you from your current point to project completion, emphasizing model training and critical analysis as required.
Step-by-Step Instructions for Completing the Assignment
Step 1: Finalize Data Preparation

    Verify Current Preprocessing:
        Ensure your updated code (which merges train_metadata.csv, additional_features.csv, color_histogram.csv, and hog_pca.csv with ClassId) produces a training DataFrame with 5,488 rows and no missing values.
        Check the test DataFrame (2,353 rows) to confirm it includes all features but no labels, with consistent preprocessing (e.g., mean imputation, standardization using the training scaler).
        Inspect the saved CSVs (preprocessed_features.csv, preprocessed_test_features.csv) to verify they contain the expected columns and rows.
    Analyze Data Characteristics:
        Examine the class distribution plot (generated in your updated code) to identify imbalances (e.g., some traffic sign classes may have fewer samples).
        Visualize sample images from train_metadata.csv to understand challenges like varying lighting, angles, or occlusions, which will inform feature engineering.
        Check feature distributions (e.g., histograms of color or HOG features) to confirm standardization and identify any outliers.
    Handle Any Remaining Issues:
        If the merge resulted in fewer than 5,488 training rows, investigate mismatched image_path values and adjust the merge (e.g., check for trailing spaces or file path inconsistencies).
        If missing values persist, review the imputation strategy (mean for numeric, mode for categorical) and ensure it’s appropriate for each feature’s distribution.

Step 2: Engineer Additional Features

The project requires you to go beyond the provided features (color histograms, HOG, edge density, texture variance, average color channels). Feature engineering is critical for improving model performance and demonstrating creativity.

    Access Raw Images:
        Use the image_path column in train_metadata.csv and test_metadata.csv to load training and test images.
        Test image loading on a small subset to ensure paths are correct and images are accessible.
    Extract New Features:
        Edge Features: Apply Canny edge detection to capture sign boundaries, which are distinct for shapes like circles or triangles. Compute metrics like edge pixel count or edge intensity.
        Color Features: Calculate hue/saturation histograms in HSV color space to capture color patterns (e.g., red for stop signs, blue for mandatory signs). Alternatively, compute dominant colors or color ratios.
        Shape Features: Measure geometric properties like circularity (for circular signs) or aspect ratio to differentiate sign shapes.
        Texture Features: Use Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to capture texture variations, which can distinguish signs with similar shapes.
        Apply these methods to both training and test images to ensure consistency.
    Integrate New Features:
        Append the new features to your preprocessed training and test DataFrames, creating new columns alongside the provided features.
        Standardize the new features using the same scaler as the original features to maintain consistency.
        Save the updated DataFrames to new CSVs for reproducibility.
    Select Informative Features:
        Evaluate feature importance using a simple model (e.g., Decision Tree) to identify which features (provided or engineered) contribute most to classification.
        Remove redundant or low-importance features to reduce noise and improve model efficiency.

Step 3: Train Machine Learning Models

Since you’re unsure about model training, this step provides a clear plan to get started and meet the requirement of 2–4 models (or 4–5 with an ensemble for groups).

    Select Models:
        Individual: Choose 2–4 distinct models. Start with:
            k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): Simple and effective for high-dimensional features like histograms; requires standardized features.
            Decision Trees: Interpretable and good for non-linear relationships.
            Support Vector Machine (SVM): Strong for high-dimensional data; try linear or RBF kernels.
            Logistic Regression: Simple baseline for multi-class classification.
        Group of 2: Select 4–5 models, including a stacking ensemble that combines predictions from base models (e.g., using Logistic Regression as the meta-learner).
    Prepare Data for Training:
        Split the training DataFrame into features (X: all columns except image_path and ClassId) and labels (y: ClassId).
        Use 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance estimates, or split the data into 80% training (~4,390 samples) and 20% validation (~1,098 samples) for initial testing.
    Train a Baseline Model:
        Start with a simple model like kNN or Decision Trees using the preprocessed features (without new features initially).
        Evaluate accuracy on the validation set or via cross-validation to establish a baseline.
        Generate a confusion matrix to identify misclassified classes.
    Incorporate Engineered Features:
        Retrain the baseline model with the updated feature set (provided + engineered features).
        Compare performance to see if new features improve accuracy.
    Tune Hyperparameters:
        For each model, tune key hyperparameters:
            kNN: Number of neighbors (k).
            Decision Trees: Maximum depth, minimum samples per split.
            SVM: Regularization parameter (C), kernel type.
            Logistic Regression: Regularization strength (C).
        Use grid search or random search on the validation set to find optimal settings.
    Train Additional Models:
        Train the remaining models (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression) on the same feature set.
        Compare validation performance to identify the best models.
    For Groups: Build the Ensemble:
        Collect predictions from base models on the validation set.
        Train a stacking ensemble (e.g., Logistic Regression) using these predictions as input features.
        Evaluate the ensemble to ensure it improves over individual models.

Step 4: Evaluate Models and Perform Error Analysis

    Evaluate Performance:
        Compute accuracy for each model on the validation set or via cross-validation.
        Calculate additional metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) if class imbalance is significant (based on the class distribution plot).
        Generate confusion matrices to identify which classes are frequently misclassified (e.g., similar-looking speed limit signs).
    Analyze Errors:
        Investigate misclassified samples:
            Visualize misclassified images to check for issues like poor lighting, occlusions, or similar sign appearances.
            Correlate errors with specific features (e.g., are HOG features less effective for certain classes?).
        Hypothesize causes:
            Feature Issues: Are some features not discriminative enough?
            Model Issues: Is the model overfitting (high training accuracy, low validation accuracy) or underfitting?
            Data Issues: Are some classes underrepresented or affected by image quality?
        Document findings for the report’s Discussion section.
    Iterate to Improve:
        Refine features (e.g., add new features or remove noisy ones) or adjust hyperparameters based on error analysis.
        Retrain and re-evaluate models to boost performance.

Step 5: Generate Test Predictions for Kaggle

    Train Final Models:
        Select the best-performing models (or ensemble for groups) based on validation performance.
        Retrain these models on the entire training set (no validation split) to maximize learning.
    Predict on Test Set:
        Apply the trained models to the preprocessed test features (from preprocessed_test_features.csv).
        Format predictions as a CSV with columns image_path and ClassId, matching Kaggle’s requirements.
        If using multiple models, select the best model or average predictions for better robustness.
    Submit to Kaggle:
        Access the Kaggle in-class competition using your student email (URL on Canvas).
        Submit the prediction CSV (up to 8 submissions per day).
        Monitor the public leaderboard (based on 50% of test data) and test different models or feature sets.
        Select the best submission as your final one before the competition closes.

Step 6: Write the Report

    Structure the Report:
        Introduction: Describe the traffic sign classification task, GTSRB dataset, and your approach.
        Methodology: Explain preprocessing (e.g., mean imputation, standardization), feature engineering (e.g., edge detection, color histograms), and model choices conceptually.
        Results: Present validation accuracies, confusion matrices, and any Kaggle leaderboard results. Include visualizations (e.g., class distribution plot, model comparison bar charts).
        Discussion and Critical Analysis: Analyze why models performed differently, linking to theory (e.g., SVM’s strength in high-dimensional spaces, Decision Trees’ interpretability). Discuss error patterns and feature effectiveness.
        Conclusion: Summarize findings, lessons learned, and potential improvements.
        References: Cite resources (e.g., GTSRB dataset, machine learning textbooks).
    Adhere to Guidelines:
        Keep within the word limit (1,300–1,800 for individuals, 2,000–2,500 for groups, excluding references, captions, and tables).
        Use the provided LaTeX or Word style files and submit as a single PDF via Canvas by May 23, 2025, 7:00 pm.
    Emphasize Critical Analysis:
        Focus on explaining model performance and feature impacts, connecting to course concepts (e.g., bias-variance tradeoff, feature scaling).
        Use error analysis to highlight insights (e.g., why certain signs were misclassified).

Step 7: Submit Deliverables

    Code:
        Ensure your Jupyter Notebook is well-documented with markdown cells explaining each step (preprocessing, feature engineering, model training).
        Verify the code is executable and reproduces the results reported.
        Submit via Canvas.
    Kaggle Submission:
        Submit at least one prediction file to earn 1 mark; aim for >50% accuracy for the second mark.
        Monitor the leaderboard and refine submissions as needed.
    Report:
        Submit the PDF report via Canvas by the deadline.
        Ensure it meets the word count and includes all required sections.
    Group Registration (if applicable):
        If in a group, one member must register via Canvas by May 9, 2025, 11:59 pm. Only one member submits deliverables.

Additional Tips

    Time Management: Allocate time for feature engineering (3–4 days), model training/evaluation (3–4 days), error analysis (2–3 days), and report writing (3–4 days).
    Start with a Baseline: Train a simple model (e.g., kNN) on the current features to get initial results, then improve with engineered features.
    Iterate Early: Test feature extraction and models on small data subsets to save time.
    Document for Report: Note preprocessing decisions, model performance, and error analysis in your notebook for easy transfer to the report.
    Kaggle Strategy: Use multiple submissions to experiment, but select the best-performing one as your final submission.
